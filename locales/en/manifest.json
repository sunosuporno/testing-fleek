    "intro.introduction":"The CatalanDAO emerges as a Catalan digital nation open to the world.",
    "intro.text":"Everyone is welcome to launch and experiment with cultural, economic, and social projects through the decentralized technologies of the Web3. We want to improve the well-being of people, promote Catalan culture, and contribute to the sustainability of the planet.",
    "section.first":"1/ The CatalanDAO draws from a historical tradition of managing common-pool resources (commons) across the Catalan Countries, from the medieval emprius and alous to the Tribunal d’Aigües de València and the experiences of collectivization before the Francoist dictatorship. Today we are inspired by the cooperative movement, with thousands of companies, the Third Social Sector, which represents close to 10 % of the GDP of Catalonia, and initiatives such as Guifi.net, the largest commons-based telecommunications network in the world.",
    "section.second":"2/ The CatalanDAO draws from pioneering organizational models such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that are largely inspired by self-management initiatives in the Catalan Countries, as well as by the experience of members of the Ethereum community who are familiar with them.",
    "section.third":"3/ The CatalanDAO is part of a new ecosystem of decentralized networks and applications, the web3. The web3 opens the door to imagining new forms of social and political organizations that will lead to structural transformations. The decentralized technology of the Web3 makes it possible to develop sovereign projects resistant to any form of censorship.",
    "section.fourth":"4/ The CatalanDAO is a community of Catalan digital citizens open to anyone who wants to become one of them.",
    "section.fith":"5/ The CatalanDAO will leverage sovereign digital identity, zero-knowledge cryptography, open and modular protocols, fungible and non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance.",
    "section.sixth":"6/ The CatalanDAO proposes to explore and test new forms of governance and sustainable economic models.",
    "outro.text":"In short, the CatalanDAO is part of a new organizational paradigm that makes it possible to develop new forms of organization, relationships, and collective action.",
    "outro.pio":"Pioneers, explorers, curiosity-driven people, citizens from all over the cyberspace... Ja som aquí!",
